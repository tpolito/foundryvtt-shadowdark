The gods.</p><p></p><p>You hold ultimate power.</p><p></p><p>Yet you only want one thing: to see your players triumph.</p><p></p><p>So you craft malevolent villains worth defeating. You sculpt marvelous treasures worth stealing. You fill the world with rot, darkness, and death so it can be driven back by sword, spell, and flame.</p><p></p><p>Through this, you offer an invitation. You propose it loudly with roaring dragons, humbly with helpless villagers, secretly with hidden treasure maps.</p><p></p><p>You call the players to adventure.</p><p></p><p>And they answer.</p>",
