The GM adds the highest DEX modifier of any monsters, if relevant.</p><p></p><p>The person who rolled the highest takes the first turn, and the turn order moves clockwise from that individual.</p><p></p><p><strong>PLAYER TURN</strong></p><ol><li><p>The player counts down any personal timers for spells and other effects.</p></li><li><p>The player takes an action and may move up to near (split up in any way).
