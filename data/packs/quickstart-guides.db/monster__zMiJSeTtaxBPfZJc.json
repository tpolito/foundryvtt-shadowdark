You can also use the average total listed.</p><p></p><p><strong>ATTACKS</strong></p><p>Most monsters can make one or two attacks per turn (ATK), but some can make more. Attack bonuses and damage are listed for each.</p><p></p><p><strong>MOVEMENT</strong></p><p>Monsters can typically move (MV) near each turn, but some can move other distances. If a monster has a special mode of movement, such as flying or swimming, it is noted after the distance.</p><p></p><p><strong>STAT MODIFIERS</strong></p><p>Monsters have modifiers listed for Strength (S), Dexterity (D), Constitution (C), Intelligence (I), Wisdom (W), and Charisma (Ch).</p><p></p><p><strong>ALIGNMENT</strong></p><p>All monsters have a typical alignment (AL) for their species. Individual monsters might have a different alignment.</p><p></p><p><strong>SPELLCASTING</strong></p><p>Treat monster spellcasting the same as character spellcasting. For a natural 1 on an INT or CHA spell, roll on the Wizard Mishap tables (pg. 46). A natural 1 on a WIS spell incurs penance. The tier is the spellcasting DC - 10.</p><p></p><p>DARK-ADAPTED</p><p>All non-humanoid monsters are dark-adapted. Their powerful senses allow them to ignore the penalties of total darkness (see pg. 84). Blinding or deafening a monster still hinders it.</p>",
