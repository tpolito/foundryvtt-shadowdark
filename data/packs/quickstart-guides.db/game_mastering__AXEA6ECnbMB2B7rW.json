Their legacy is now yours.</p><p></p><p>As the Game Master, it is your job to lead the table in all things.</p><p>That means you set the bar. The way you speak, the energy you bring to the game, and the speed you set carries over to everyone else around you.</p><p></p><p>There will be times when you must guide a shy player, when you must firmly call for focus during off-topic chatter, and when you must declare in a hushed whisper that all fate hangs on the single roll of a die.</p><p></p><p>Do not shrink from your task. Even when all light is extinguished, all hit points gone, it is you who carries the torch.</p>",
