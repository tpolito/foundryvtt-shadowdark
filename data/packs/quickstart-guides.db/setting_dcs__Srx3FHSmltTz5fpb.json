Finding a trail in a sunny field would be an easy task for a forest elf with tracking skills, but it would be a hard task for a sun-dazzled cave troll.</p><p></p><p>When you ask players to make a check, state what kind of check it is. For example, an easy Charisma check or a DC 15 Dexterity check. That way, the players know what they need to roll to succeed.</p>",
