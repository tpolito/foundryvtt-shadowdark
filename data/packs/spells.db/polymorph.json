The target gains the creature's physical stats and features, but it retains its non-physical stats and features. If the target goes to 0 hit points, it reverts to its true form at half its prior hit points. You can target any willing creature with this spell, or an unwilling creature whose level is less than or equal to half your level rounded down (min. 1).</p>",
